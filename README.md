You can type any text in markdown. You can write *italic* text and **bold text**.

You can provide inline code as `int var = 42;` or an entire code section as

```python
def force(m, a):
    return m * a
```

Need a list, like a table of content? No problem!

1. First section
2. Second section
3. Thirs section

How about a non-numbered list?

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

We can easily embed links in our text using [this syntax](https://www.google.com)

It might be useful to track progress with a Todo list, no problem either

- [x] Alread done
- [x] Certainly done as well
- [ ] Still need to work on this
